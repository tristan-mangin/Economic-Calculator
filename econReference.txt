GDP:

    GDP = C + I + G + NX
        = C + I + G + (exports - imports)

UNEMPLOYMENT RATE:

    UR = (Unemployed / labor force) * 100

MONEY MULTIPLIER:

    Money Multiplier = 1 / reserve ratio

REAL GDP:
 
    Real GDP = (nominal GDP / GDP deflator) * 100

CPI:

    CPI = (Cost of basket in current year / cost of basket in base year) * 100

Interest Rates:
                                        n
    Compounding interest: FV = PV(1 + i)

                                                n
    Discounting interest: PV =     FV / [(1 + i) ]
                                
                                                                     n                 n
    PV = P = (P * (1 + i)) / (1 + i) + ... + (P * (1 + i)) / [(1 + i) ] + FV / [(1 + i) ]

                  FV
    YTM = i = ___________  - 1          (same for simple loan and discount bond)
                Principle
                                               n
    YTM fixed payment loan = i =  FP / [(1 + i) ]   

    Capital gain/loss = change in P / original P

    Expected return = (coupon rate + change in P) / Purchased P = coupon / purchase P + change in P / purchase P
